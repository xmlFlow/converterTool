To the guṭha 3 established by your ancestor Jīvarāja Bā̃ḍā when he offered a golden <span class="foreign">vimāna</span> 4 to the chariot of 1 (i.e., Matsyendranātha) were added further rice field plots with money left over after it completed its tasks. It is learned that you (i.e., the <span class="foreign">guṭha</span> members) have been tending to those plots as well. It is also learned that up to the present you have been renovating the <span class="foreign">vimāna</span> whenever it is damaged. You still enjoyed [the fruits of] the <span class="foreign">guṭha</span> for two or three years after [the start of] our rule. Earlier during [the Gorkha troops'] blockade of the region 6 , when you took to Bhādagāũ, in order to hide them there, the documents relating to the donation of the <span class="foreign">guṭha</span>, [the documents] were grabbed by Bhoṭyās. However, it is learned that the well-informed among the twenty-four thousand 7 [households/people] know [that you are the rightful overseers of the <span class="foreign">guṭha</span>]. Later, when the <span class="foreign">ijārā</span> [system] was instituted, you gave up the plots but did not give up the regular duties [of the <span class="foreign">guṭha</span>]. It is [further] learned that you still had to renovate [the <span class="foreign">vimāna</span>] whenever it was damaged, even after the <span class="foreign">ijārā</span> [obligations on the part of the <span class="foreign">guṭha</span>] had been forgiven, and that you were unable to make use of the <span class="foreign">guṭha</span> established by your ancestors.</p></div><div lang="eng" class="commentary" id="commentary"><h2 lang="eng"><span class="headingNumber">4. </span></h2><p>This document is a copy of an executive order seemingly issued by King <span class="persName">Gīrvāṇayuddha</span> to Rāmānanda Bā̃ḍā of <span class="placeName">Oku Bāhāla</span> in <span class="geogName">Patan</span>. It grants Rāmānanda and his fellow <span class="foreign">guṭha</span> members the right to retain overseership of the Luthāma Guṭha and its land endowments. It was issued in response to a petition by Rāmānanda and is mentioned in a note appended to document E_2253_0015B. There is a gap of one year between this and the previous document<span id="Note3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Footnote commentary: interesting very gutha tugha." href="#Note3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> E_2253_0015B, leading one to believe that Rāmānanda had to wait that long to get this <span class="foreign">rukkā</span> issued.</p><p>Rāmānanda apparently did not possess any proof of his right to the Luthāma Guṭha. As the document mentions, this was because his papers were taken by Bhoṭes when he fled to Bhaktapur during attacks by Gorkhali troops in Patan. The king, however, acknowledges his right to the <span class="foreign">guṭha</span> based on information obtained from the general public. No names of suppliers of such information are mentioned, nor does the document provide any details about the Bhoṭes who took the documents. If the ethnonym Bhoṭe refers to Tibetanid peoples, it is puzzling how they could have overpowered Rāmānanda in Bhaktapur, which was still ruled by a Newar king. One may also assume that the documents were taken while he was on his way to Bhaktapur.</p><p>The document lists 14 pieces of plots amounting to 69 ropanīs as the endowment of the guṭha. Although some of the place names cannot be identified, it is likely that all the plots were in or around Lalitpur district. It is interesting to note that Bruce Owens's study during the 1980s found 36 ropanīs of land remaining with the guṭha (see Owens 1989: 274). This was only half of the original amount of land mentioned in the current document. Owens further mentions that the "<span class="foreign">guṭhiyar</span> complains of having difficulty extracting the <span class="foreign">guṭhī's</span> share of the proceeds from its tenants" (ibid.).</p><p>The document has a note appended at the end which mentions that Amālī Śaṅkhadhara had asked the guṭha members to verify their status through Patan's notables. It is interesting that an amāli could object to a right already granted by the king. Could a local authority overrule the king's order? Or was this merely a bureaucratic formality?Commentry <span id="Note4_return"><a class="notelink" title="This is a commentary footnote" href="#Note4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p></div><!--TEI back--><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1 </span><div class="noteBody">The text written in the right margin has been blacked out with ink.</div></div><div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2 </span><div class="noteBody">The name of the king is not mentioned here, but it is evident from the date of the document that it was <span class="persName">Gīrvāṇayuddha Vikrama Śāha</span> (r. 1799-1816).
