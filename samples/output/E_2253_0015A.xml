        <p>The document of this which is a copy is an account made to an unknown addressee by Rāmānanda Bā̃ḍā describing how in VS 1859 control of the Luthāma Guṭhī, a Matsyendranātha-related trust, had been misused by Bhājudhana Jaisi, and how the sender had petitioned Rudravīra Sāha and Bam Sāha to regain control of the guṭhī.</p>

        <p>This document is the first in a series of documents concerning a legal issue that arose in 1802 over the ownership of the Luthāma (lit. golden pillars) Guṭha. According to the NGMPP catalogue card, these copied documents were in the collection of <persName> Manoj Rajopadhyaya </persName> of Kathmandu. In the current document, Rāmānanda Bā̃ḍā explains how in the year VS 1859 he realized that Bhājudhana Jaisi was misusing his authority over the Luthāma Guṭha, and how he made petition to Rudravīra Sāha, wherein he justified his claim to regain control of the guṭhī. Rudravīra's order to Bhājudhana to immediately return charge of the guṭhī went unheeded, and Rāmānanda had to make petition to Bam Sāha instead.</p>
        <p>The document omits dates and the name of the writer. However, it mentions the year VS (18)59 in its main body, and since document E_2253_0015B, which is Cautariyā Bam Sāha's response to the writer's petition, is dated Śrāvaṇa of that year, we can safely assume that the period this document covers lies within the first four months of the year. Similarly, the writer can be determined to have been Rāmānanda Bā̃ḍā, as E_2253_0015B is addressed to him.</p>
        <p>As the document mentions, the disputed Luthāma Guṭhī was established when Jīvarāja Bā̃ḍā donated the vimāna to the chariot of Matsyendranātha. Jīvarāja, with whom the writer of the document claimed ancestry, was a resident of Oku Bāhāla 8 in Patan and is credited with completing Mahābuddha Temple<note place="end"> Alternatively known as Bodhimaṇḍapa Vihāra, and sometimes wrongly spelled as Mahābauddha, this śikhara styled temple is a branch of <placeName> Oku Bāhāla </placeName>. For an inventory of this temple in the DANAM database, see: .</note>.</p>
