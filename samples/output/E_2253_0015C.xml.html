It grants Rāmānanda and his fellow <span class="foreign">guṭha</span> members the right to retain overseership of the Luthāma Guṭha and its land endowments. It was issued in response to a petition by Rāmānanda and is mentioned in a note appended to document E_2253_0015B. There is a gap of one year between this and the previous document <span id="Note4_return"><a class="notelink" title="Footnote commentary: interesting very gutha tugha." href="#Note4"><sup>3</sup></a></span> E_2253_0015B, leading one to believe that Rāmānanda had to wait that long to get this <span class="foreign">rukkā </span> issued.</p><p>Rāmānanda apparently did not possess any proof of his right to the Luthāma Guṭha. As the document mentions, this was because his papers were taken by Bhoṭes when he fled to Bhaktapur during attacks by Gorkhali troops in Patan. <span class="foreign">The king, however, acknowledges his right to the guṭha based on information obtained from the general public. </span> No names of suppliers of such information are mentioned, nor does the document provide any details about the Bhoṭes who took the documents. If the ethnonym Bhoṭe refers to Tibetanid peoples, it is puzzling how they could have overpowered Rāmānanda in Bhaktapur, which was still ruled by a Newar king. One may also assume that the documents were taken while he was on his way to Bhaktapur.</p><p>The document lists 14 pieces of plots amounting to 69 <span class="foreign">ropanīs</span> as the endowment of the <span class="foreign">guṭha</span>. Although some of the place names cannot be identified, it is likely that all the plots were in or around Lalitpur district. It is interesting to note that Bruce Owens's study during the 1980s found 36 <span class="foreign">ropanīs</span> of land remaining with the <span class="foreign">guṭha </span> (see Owens 1989: 274). This was only half of the original amount of land mentioned in the current document. Owens further mentions that the "<span class="foreign">guṭhiyar</span> complains of having difficulty extracting the <span class="foreign">guṭhī's</span> share of the proceeds from its tenants" (ibid.).</p><p>The document has a note appended at the end which mentions that Amālī Śaṅkhadhara had asked the <span class="foreign">guṭha </span> members to verify their status through Patan's notables. It is interesting that an <span class="foreign">amāli </span> could object to a right already granted by the king. Could a local authority overrule the king's order?
